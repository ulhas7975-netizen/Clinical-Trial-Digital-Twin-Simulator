# Clinical-Trial-Digital-Twin-Simulator
A digital twin is a virtual model of a real patient, created using demographic, genetic, and health data. By generating a digital population, researchers can test new drug protocols or treatment strategies virtually before conducting real-world trials.


#Problem Statement
##Clinical trials are one of the most expensive, time-consuming, and high-risk stages in drug development.
On average, a single clinical trial can cost millions of dollars and take several years to complete.

#Proposed Solution â€” Clinical Trial Digital Twin Simulator

#The Clinical Trial Digital Twin Simulator provides a virtual testing environment that uses AI-generated digital twins (virtual patient models) to simulate clinical trials.
